This repository contains the analytical work for challenge:

- Superintendencia de Sociedades

The project follows a modular structure. Shared logic lives in a common core; challenge-specific logic lives in dedicated modules.

## Dashboards

**Sectora Horizon** runs on **Metabase**, powered by **PostgreSQL** as the analytical engine.  
The system provides two main dashboards: **Historical** and **Predictive**.

**Access Metabase:**  
`http://super.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:3080/public/dashboard/8b77ad68-c6e5-4919-a387-0638966b4476`

---

### **1. Historical Dashboard**

- Year-over-year evolution of revenue, assets, liabilities, and equity.  
- Average financial margins by company and sector.  
- Geographic distribution by department.

**Map**

### **2. Predictive Dashboard**

Updated automatically when running the inference module:

- Projected margin by company.  
- Estimated earnings.  
- Sector ranking under different macroeconomic assumptions (PIB, interest rates).  
- Dashboards refresh automatically once PostgreSQL tables are updated.

## Predictive Model

Two specialized **LightGBM** models were trained to capture the heterogeneous behavior of Colombian companies:

- **Expert_Servicios**  
- **Expert_Resto**

Both models use **78 numerical and engineered features**, including:

- Revenue and profit lags  
- Year-over-year growth rates  
- 3-year moving averages  
- Macroeconomic variables (GDP, inflation, DTF, TRM)  
- Sectoral dummy variables  
- Interaction terms: *sector × GDP* and *sector × DTF*

---

## Final Metrics (MAE %)

| Model             | MAE     |
|------------------|---------|
| Expert_Servicios | 0.0287  |
| Expert_Resto     | 0.0307  |

Both models exhibit **high stability** and **low variance**, making them suitable for large-scale financial forecasting.
